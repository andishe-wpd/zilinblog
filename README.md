# Digi Task

his is a frontend project built with React using TypeScript. It follows best practices and utilizes modern tools and libraries such as ESLint for code linting, Atomic Design for component organization, Yarn as the package manager, Vite as the build tool, and integrates with Figma for design collaboration.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or higher): Visit [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

## Development

To start the development server, run the following command:
yarn dev
This will launch the application in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view it.

## Building the Project

To build a production-ready version of the application, run the following command:

yarn build
This will generate an optimized build in the dist directory.



## Linting

This project utilizes ESLint for code linting. To run the linter, use the following command:

yarn lint


## Atomic Design
The project follows the Atomic Design methodology for component organization. The components are structured into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages, providing a scalable and maintainable architecture.

## Design Collaboration
We use Figma for design collaboration. Access the Figma project at [link to Figma project] to view and collaborate on the designs.


## Branching Strategy
For each task or feature, create a new branch based on the master branch. Ensure that the branch name is descriptive of the task or feature being worked on. Once the task is completed, create a pull request for code review and merging it back into the master branch.
